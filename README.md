GenCon
======

GenCon provides a simple text-based display with a curses-like interface. GenCon
does not use HTML5's canvas, as most libraries like this do. I figure, if it's
text, why not implement it using text? This may be used for roguelikes, or geeky
niche applications of any sort.

Every function is documented fairly thoroughly in the code in `gencon.js`.

An example that tests out most available functionality is located in
examples/test.html
